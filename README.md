Navigate Percy's collapsing synthetic digital world created by memory, doubt, data, and experiences. Guided by the voice in his head, he pushes through a fractured reality—driven by fear and the relentless need to move forward. Synthetica 2091 is a personal journey through not only identity but purpose. 


> [!Note]
As noted in the end cutscene, I (Nathan Parker, a/k/a "Pargonate") will not update this game until the **year 2049** (May 12th). This game acts as an updating time capsule of my life, the building blocks of thought and experiences that make me—*me*. If I happen to die before 2049 or 2091, the rights will transfer to individual(s) listed in my will. From there, they're allowed to update the game ***one final time*** from the closest year of my death (2049 or 2091). It has to happen on those specified dates; there are no <u>*ifs or buts about this*</u>. These individuals will receive special instructions on how to hire/contract developers within the Godot community to update the game.

## About the Game
Synthetica 2091 is a 2D narrative-driven side-scroller platformer in which players guide PR7-2.9 ("Percy") through a world that combines his honest thoughts with his imaginary dozed-off universe—constantly forced to keep moving forward while wrestling with questions of purpose, guided only by the voice in his head.

Inspired by the works of the Blade Runner series, Nathan Parker carefully explores and expands themes of identity, humanity, memory, reality, loneliness, mortality, and legacy. Percy represents a reflection of Parker's own lived experiences—his internal dialogue rendered into an interactive, digital journey.

## Cloning Instructions

Synthetica 2091 is written entirely in C# and uses the latest and greatest [Godot 4.4 .NET (stable-mono)](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4-stable/). After you've updated to 4.4 .NET (stable-mono), you can download the source code from the [releases page](https://github.com/pargonate/synthetica-2091/releases) and import the `.zip` into the editor. 

## Contributing

As with all said, contributions are welcome if they are only minor changes. Nathan Parker (and hired Godot contractors, after my death (*if I'm unable to update by 2049 or 2091*)) are the only people allowed to make any significant changes, which will only happen in those years mentioned. 

Game-breaking bugs will be reviewed and fixed depending on their severity. As an odd game developer, I actually encourage the discovery of game-breaking glitches and/or bugs, as they're so fascinating.
