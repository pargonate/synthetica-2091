	{ "speaker": "A", "line": "Ah, there you are! Welcome PR7-2.9, I'm Abell 2218. You can just call me Abell for short." },
	{ "speaker": "P", "line": "What?! Where the hell am I?" },
	{ "speaker": "A", "line": "You're looking off in space again, probably in some classroom somewhere." },
	{ "speaker": "P", "line": "Shit. Wait! How the hell am I talking to you? You can't be real!" },
	{ "speaker": "A", "line": "Not everything in life is so straightforward PR7-2.9. Jeez, your name is a mouthful. Can I just call you... hmm.. Percy, for short?" },
	{ "speaker": "P", "line": "I guess?? What's my purpose here?" },
	{ "speaker": "A", "line": "Percy. Purpose is something YOU find. I'm just your friendly assistant here; I'm the voice in your head." },
	{ "speaker": "P", "line": "Then why can't I just be you? " },
	{ "speaker": "A", "line": "I'm a non-playable character in your mind. That's impossible, silly. Let's get you out of here. Listen to my commands, trust me." },
	{ "speaker": "P", "line": "Fuck it, let's roll." },

    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Okay, Percy, ahead are what's known as simply... uh.. let me look... \"glitches.\"" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "These don't seem very safe to stand on." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "You're right. These disappear if you stand on them too long." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Percy, you're going to have to trust me. You have to jump." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Here we go." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Ooh! Jump pad!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Sure is!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "What's that behind me?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Ah shit. That's the firewall. Don't worry about it, you have to keep going." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "WHAT? What do you mean \"dOn'T wOrRy AbOuT iT?\"" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "You want to get your ass out of here right?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Yeah??!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Well, that's not the way out, KEEP MOVING." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Fine. What's binary doing up here?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Those clusters of green bits are data streams. Stand at the base, and they will move you upwards or wherever they're pointed!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Wow. I didn't think in 2018 I would be surfing data streams." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "You also didn't think you'd fit in either, didn't you?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "We don't talk about that." },

    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Why can't I talk about it?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "You know why. I'm working on it: a new town, new people, and my best friend has been left behind." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "True. I'm sure these people will be great, though!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "I hope so too. Maybe I can even get a girlfriend?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Let's be realistic." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "You're right." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Not saying it's impossible, but you have to focus on yourself first. Rushing to things that are not in your own time is dangerous." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "When will I have time?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "There's plenty of time, but you're in the 5th grade, I wouldn't worry too much." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Maybe high school sweetheart?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Maybe. Gotta act fast though, just like an economy, it fluctuates with opportunities. You gotta invest in the one that'll profit both of you." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Also, if you don't think you'll match or you're not good enough, just let them go, and they'll find somebody else; that's the gentleman's way." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Right. If we can't both benefit, I might as well let her find someone else who fits her better, usually, with stronger muscles, active in sports, or more funny than I am. But I can't let that get to my head." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "You also gotta remember that some won't be as loyal as you thought they were, and even if you deeply plan, they might outplay you to the punch." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "But I'm an overthinker! This shit ain't fair." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "That's life. Suck it up." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "I just wanna cry." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Showing your signs of weakness, Percy, we don't have time for that." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "But you just said I did have plenty of time?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Percy. We have time to move FORWARD. Crying over something is admitting defeat." },

    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Okay! Get ready to jump again! There's a platform after the jump pad, it's to the right." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "OK." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "What about this one?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "You should be fine." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "What's that?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "That's a laser. It cycles between off and on. Time your moves!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "What's this?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "OH. PERCY!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "MAIL???" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "OH NO. Those are packet bombs! Watch out!! RUN!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "WHO THE HELL IS THAT!?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "THAT'S THE ADMIN! HE'LL KILL YOU!" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Jeez! Now I have to run away from a firewall, packet bombs, lasers, and some \"admin!\"" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "The admin kills your ability to keep going and fills your mind with doubt." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "What an awful thing to have in your head." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "It sure does hurt, it's like imposter syndrome." },

    { "speaker": "P", "line": "So what now?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Find something, anything, that you enjoy." },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Hmm. But I'm no artist!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Do you like math?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Hmm, yeah, a little bit." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Do you like making things in general?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Yeah!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Do you like helping people?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Of course. That's my dream; if I cannot help myself, then I would rather die knowing that someone has benefited from my work." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Good mentality. Most people in this world don't possess that order of thinking. Let's see what will allow you to do that easily... do you like computers?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Yes! They're so interesting, vast networks and endless possibilities. OH WAIT!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Atta boy. With this newfound knowledge, you know what to do, right?" },
    { "speaker": "P", "line": "Not precisely, but I'm sure I can make it. But, how do I know if I'm moving forward?" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "As I said earlier, not everything will be so straightforward. However, what I can promise is that you'll look back on yourself and realize how far you've come. How much effort you put in, the countless moments you've made your parents proud, and the hours of unseen work put in." },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "Even if your dreams are 2 billion light years away, you'll notice that the past will redshift and your future will blueshift. But at your speed, you won't see this. That's why we have to enjoy the things in life, Percy." },

    { "speaker": "A", "line": "WATCH OUT! THE ADMIN!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "RUN!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "THE FIREWALL!" },
    { "speaker": "A", "line": "JUMP!" }
